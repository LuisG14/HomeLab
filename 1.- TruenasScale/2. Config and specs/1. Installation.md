## TrueNAS Scale Installation 

This section provides a detailed guide on installing and setting up TrueNAS Scale on your server. 

### 1. Download TrueNAS Scale 
  - Visit the official website: [TruenasScale ](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-community-edition/)
  - Download the latest stable release in .iso format.

### 2. Create a Bootable USB
  - Utilize [BalenaEtcher](https://etcher.io/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) to flash the ISO onto a USB drive.
  - Configure your BIOS/UEFI to boot from the USB. Rufus is my preferred choice, but either can be used.

### 3. Install on the Server 
  - Choose the disk for TrueNAS Scale installation (ensure itâ€™s not one of your data drives).
  - Set the root or admin user password.
  - Complete the installation and restart the system.

### 4. First Access 
  - On start-up, TrueNAS will display the IP address for the web interface.
  - Access it from a browser, using `http://<SERVER_IP>`
  - Log in with the credentials set during the installation.
### 5. Create Pool 
  - Navigate to storage and create a pool.
  - Assign a name to your pool.
  - Select a topology for storing the information. Options include:
    - Stripe: Treats a group of disks as one. All written data is striped across each disk, promising the highest total capacity but without redundancy. If a single disk fails, all data is lost.
    - Mirror: Duplicates all written data across two or more disks. If a disk fails, a copy remains on another disk. However, the total available capacity is only equal to one disk. Optimal for redundancy, not capacity.
    - RAID-Z: A RAID version with redundancy and parity levels, allowing for data recovery if a disk fails (RAID-Z1), or even if two (RAID-Z2) or three disks fail (RAID-Z3). It offers larger total capacity than the mirror and more efficient redundancy than striping.
    - dRAID: Az proprietary RAID version developed by iXsystems. dRAID permits distributed parity across drives for optimized storage capacity. It aims to provide faster resilvering times in case of disk failures, reducing data loss risk. And, it allows disks to be added or removed immediately.
  - Enhanced features include log, spare, cache, metadata, and deduplication. However, these are optional:
    - Log: A temporary storage location where TrueNAS records data changes before permanently storing them.
    - Spare: A backup disk that TrueNAS uses if a primary disk fails.
    - Cache: A rapid-access storage area for frequently accessed data.
    - Metadata: Information about your files, such as their names and creation data.
    - Deduplication: A TrueNAS feature that avoids multiple storage of identical data to save space.
### 6. Dashboard 
  - The Dashboard is entirely modular and customizable, despite a somewhat limited range of editing or addition options. However, it still includes all vital functionalities.
